## Year
2025

## Major
Pharmacy, PhD in Bioelectronics & Brain Computer Interfaces

## Reason for Enrollement
To learn how to analyse large sets of neural signal data.

## Interest in Neuroscience
I became interested in neuroscience in the last year of my undergraduate course. My research dissertation looked at the use of conducting polymers to deliver drugs for patients with schizophrenia. My PhD became an extension of the work and I developed the skills to build brain computer interface with the capability to record, stimulate and release drugs around neural populations.

## Career Plans
I want to sharpen my data analysis skills and find a job within a neurotechnology start up. Ideally a start up that focuses on the use of brain computer interfaces for patients with neurological diseases. Over time I would like to grow within these companies and become a senior figure in the field, serving as a technical advisor for rising neurotech companies.
